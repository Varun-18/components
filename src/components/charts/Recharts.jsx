/**
 *  This is a custom chart component that explain how to use a line chart with refrence area and refrence line
 *
 * @RespponsiveContainer : This is a wrapper that makes the chart responsive according to the screen size
 *
 * 1) Height & width : one of the height or width must be a precentage string in order to make the chart responsive
 *
 * @RefrenceLine : This is the component thats takes a point on x or y axis and creates a refrence line we can customise the line and my making it dashed or changing the color along with many other properties
 *
 * 1) y : specifies the point on y axis for the refrence line
 * 2) stroke : the color  of the refrence line
 *
 * @ReferenceArea : This component give the area that you want to be highlighted in the graph and this can be achived by spcifying the  x or  y coordinates
 *
 * 1) You can also give both x & y coordinates if you  just want to highlight a block
 * 2) If you do not specify the x coordinates then the entire area of x axis with be highlighted same for the y axis
 * 3) Opacity and the color of the area can also be specified by using stroke,fill & opacity properties
 * 4) y1 & y2 : the lower limit and the upper limit of the y axis
 *
 * @Line : This components is used to specify the line that we want to plot in the graph
 *
 * 1) dataKey : The key of the data that we want to plot
 * 2) dot : to spcify the properties of the dot in the in active state
 * 3) active dot : to specify the property of the dot in the active state
 * 4) strokeDasharray : to make the ploted line dashed / use "0 0" if you want a solid line
 *
 * @Recharts : https://recharts.org
 *
 * @returns A chart using that has a refrence line and a higlighted refrence area using the rechart library
